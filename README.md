# Virtual reality in Architecture

## About:

My project explores the application of virtual reality (VR) technology in the fields of architecture and interior design, offering interactive, three-dimensional modeling solutions. The goal is to develop a VR-based interface that makes it easier for users to intuitively and realistically explore designs even before the construction work begins. During the development of the project, I worked with AutoCAD, Blender, and Unity software. In my thesis, I collaborated with a civil engineer to achieve the most precise result possible. The final outcome is a realistic VR experience that aids the user in visually understanding the arrangement of furniture and interior spaces. Based on my results, VR technology can significantly enhance the efficiency of the design process.
